# nltkFox
Using NLTK analyze Fox New.

I read FoxNews everyday.

Fox media has such control of America and articles are always changing, over 1500 a week. 
I wanted to get rid of the crap and collect just the "words".  I wrote a quick and dirty
FoxSucker. The program sucks the articles from fox news and strores it in a MongoDB.

I have a cron job that runs every hour sucks the new articles,  It also keeps track of how long
an article is displayed. 

The reason I am doing this because Fox produces deceptive media.
I was reading an article about Tump's firing of watchdogs. One sentence caught my eye.
"... Obama release sone watchdogs under conspicuous circumstances"
conspicuous means showy, flashy, rich. But quick browsing and small vocabulary would Substitute the 
word "suspicious"  
Obama did not have any suspicious dealing with any watchdog.But to large demographic of 
FoxNews consumers were decived.
